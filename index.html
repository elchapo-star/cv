       I am a professor at Cornell University. 
       My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems, 
       and their broader societal implications. 
       My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship,
       a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship,
       and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. 
       I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and
       Sciences.
